### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m in a position to do the projects I want to do, with technologies I prefer. I 100% believe in standards
- ðŸŒ± I stopped learning Svelte (and Vue, React, Angular) and won't use Qwik or Lit (and its 60+ alternatives) I stick to what the [WHATWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG) gives me
- ðŸ’¬ I share my Web Components and SVG knowlegde on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2520800/danny-365csi-engelman)
